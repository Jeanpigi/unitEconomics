# Unit Economics

This project will walk you through the basic concepts of unit economics. Unit economics is a crucial concept for understanding the financial health of your business. In this example, you will learn about the different types of units and how they affect your business's financial health.

## Calculating Unit Economics

The following metrics for each unit sold:

1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): This is the cost of acquiring a new customer. It includes marketing expenses.

CAC = Monthly Marketing Expenses / Number of Units Sold
CAC = $5,000 / 1,000 = $5 per unit

2. Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU): This is the average revenue generated from each unit sold.

ARPU = Monthly Revenue / Number of Units Sold
ARPU = $50,000 / 1,000 = $50 per unit

3. Gross Margin per Unit: This is the profit generated from each unit sold after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS).

Gross Margin per Unit = (Monthly Revenue - COGS) / Number of Units Sold
Gross Margin per Unit = ($50,000 - $30,000) / 1,000 = $20 per unit

4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): This is the total revenue generated from a customer over their lifetime. Let's assume the average customer stays with TechStore for 12 months.

CLV = ARPU x Average Customer Lifespan
CLV = $50 x 12 = $600 per customer

5. Customer Retention Rate: This is the percentage of customers that continue to make purchases from TechStore.

Customer Retention Rate = (Number of Customers at the End of the Month / Number of Customers at the Start of the Month) x 100.
Assuming TechStore starts the month with 500 customers and ends with 550 customers:
Customer Retention Rate = (550 / 500) x 100 = 110%
